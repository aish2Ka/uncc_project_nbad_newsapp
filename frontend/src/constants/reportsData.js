        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Professors Maja Godlewska and Marek Ranis, renowned artists and residents of Charlotte, have created an immersive art installation titled <em>Mare Liberum, Reimagined</em>. This project is part of the national initiative <strong>Transformative Currents: Art and Action in the Pacific Ocean</strong>. The initiative brings together artists from the Pacific Rim whose works engage with the environmental challenges facing the Pacific Ocean, particularly the rising threat to the region's kelp forests.</p>
    
        <h4>Background on the Artists</h4>
        <p>Both Godlewska and Ranis, who are natives of Poland, were initially considered outsiders in this project. However, their deep connection to environmental causes and art has enabled them to create meaningful work. Godlewska has previously spent time in places like Tasmania, Mauritius, and national parks across the U.S., where she created large-scale paintings and mixed-media works inspired by nature. Ranis, with over 20 years of experience in the Arctic regions, has also focused his work on climate change and its effects on polar regions.</p>
    
        <h4>Research and Collaboration</h4>
        <p>When invited to participate in <strong>Transformative Currents</strong>, Godlewska and Ranis traveled to Southern California in 2021 and 2022 to conduct research. They met with scientists at the University of California Irvine and collaborated with environmental non-profits such as Get Inspired. Their research also took them to Crystal Cove State Park, where they learned about local conservation efforts and the significance of kelp forests to both the ecosystem and the surrounding community.</p>
    
        <h4>Importance of Kelp Forests</h4>
        <p>Kelp, a type of marine algae, plays a critical role in carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen production. Additionally, it serves as a habitat and food source for a variety of marine species. However, rising ocean temperatures are endangering these vital kelp forests, which are crucial to maintaining the health of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
    
        <h4>The Immersive Installation</h4>
        <p>The artists were captivated by the unique qualities of kelp, and their project <em>Mare Liberum, Reimagined</em> reflects this fascination. Ranis used a 360-degree underwater video camera to capture footage of the kelp forest in its natural habitat off the coast of California. After returning to their studio, Godlewska painted long mesh panels, which were then suspended from the ceiling to create a simulated kelp forest within the gallery space.</p>
    
        <h4>Virtual Reality Experience</h4>
        <p>The immersive experience is further enhanced with virtual reality (VR) headsets. When visitors put on the VR headsets, they are transported into the underwater world of the kelp forest. They navigate through the glowing kelp, while hearing from marine conservation experts whom the artists consulted during their research. The experts featured in the installation include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diane Kim, University of Southern California Environmental Scientist</li>
          <li>Nancy Caruso, Founder of Get Inspired</li>
          <li>Captain Charles Moore, Oceanographer</li>
          <li>Erick Valdez, Education Manager at San Diego Coastkeeper</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Impact and Purpose</h4>
        <p>Through this installation, Godlewska and Ranis aim to raise awareness about the fragility of kelp forests and the broader issues of climate change affecting the Pacific Ocean ecosystem. The installation is a powerful example of how art can contribute to environmental advocacy and encourage deeper engagement with critical ecological issues.</p>
